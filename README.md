### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
- Log in to your GitHub account. navigate to (link for project)
- You can set up your own repository and copy or clone it, or you fork the repository.
- Git add, git commit and git push to a GitHub repository, if necessary.
- GitHub pages will update from the master branch by default.
- Go to the Settings page of the repository.
- Scroll down to the Github Pages section.
- Select the Master Branch as the source and Confirm the selection.
