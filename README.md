### Features Left to Implement

- I was hoping to add in my score leaderboard for the quiz. I went through it with guidance and a youtube video but soon released that it seem
quite alot to take on board with the deadline coming up so my mentor suggested I focused on more basic functions and really come to grips with undertanding my project.

### Unfixed Bugs

There was an issue with my end.html file path that I had to leave unfixed due to the project time deadline. Everything was working fine on the broswer from my workspace.
The live link from github was showing a 404.error page just on my end.html file. The same thing happened to my background image so I changed the file path to a relative path for github. I also did the
same for my end.html and I taught the issue would have been resolved. Unfortunately I would have liked to dive into this issue further as it should have been an easy fix.
## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
- Log in to your GitHub account. navigate to (link for project)
- You can set up your own repository and copy or clone it, or you fork the repository.
- Git add, git commit and git push to a GitHub repository, if necessary.
- GitHub pages will update from the master branch by default.
- Go to the Settings page of the repository.
- Scroll down to the Github Pages section.
- Select the Master Branch as the source and Confirm the selection.
- Wait a minute or two and it should be live for viewing. See my own here.

## Credits 

- I also found my mentor Rory Fitzpatrick so supportive and he had me focused on the important elements and gave me confidence to get stuck into Javascript.
- I had the support of a friend called Michael Howlin who is a senior developer, he broke down some of the functions so I gained a deeper understanding of the Javascript.


### Content 

- I found James Q Quirks video on youtube a big help especially to structure the choice questions with javascript.
- I used all my images from Canva as I installed the pro version
